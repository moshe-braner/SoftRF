### Latest additions:

* vMB162: overwrite oldest flight log if space tight, 12.5 KHz dev for PilotAware
* vMB161: special callsign prefixes for ADS-R and TIS-B in the PFLAA
* vMB160: setting to control the time traffic not-heard from-is reported
* vMB157: revert approx math, optimize TinyGPS, bug fixes
* vMB156: GNSS baud rate autodetection, option to log NMEA to SD card
* vMB155: collect statistics on reception range by relative direction 
* vMB153: record compressed flight logs in flash memory (T-Beam & T-Echo)
* vMB152: settings stored in an editable text file
* vMB149: handles Mode-S in addition to ADS-B
* vMB140: supports adding an SD card and writing flight logs on the T-Beam
* vMB138: supports using add-on GNSS modules, on the T-Beam
* vMB130: supports the GNS5892R ADS-B receiver module, on the T-Beam
* vMB120: supports the latest 2024 radio protocol
* vMB114: import traffic data in GDL90 format (from ADS-B receiver)
* vMB110: added second serial port and data bridging (only on T-Beam)

### Beyond Lyusupov's version:

* Collision prediction for circling aircraft
* Can set aircraft ID for self, ID to ignore, and ID to follow
* Support 3-level collision alarms via buzzer
* Can configure two simultaneous NMEA output destinations
* Settable baud rate for serial output
* Estimates wind while circling, uses for collision prediction
* Corrected frequency hopping and time slots
* Airborne devices can relay radio packets from landed aircraft
* Can adjust SoftRF settings within T-Echo (without an app)

### And on the T-Beam specifically: 

* Louder buzzer via 2-pin differential drive, or external
* Collision-danger traffic VOICE warnings!
* Includes strobe-control logic
* Option to connect to ambient WiFi network instead of creating one
* Option to send data as TCP client instead of TCP server
* Specify server's IP address for TCP client, and choice of 2 ports
* Ability to use WiFi TCP & UDP NMEA outputs simultaneously
* These WiFi options allow wireless output to XCvario
* Detect and use OLED display on either I2C port
* Winch mode ("aircraft type") with variable reported altitude
